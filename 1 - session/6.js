// 6. Write a function that takes a string as input and determines if it is longer than 5 characters.

const checkLength = num => num.length > 5 ? "more than 5 characters" : "less than 5 characters"

// Your ES6 code here
console.log(checkLength('Programming')) // more than 5 characters
console.log(checkLength('Jeep')) // less than 5 characters
